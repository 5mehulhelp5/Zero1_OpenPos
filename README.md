Restrict access to admin session only


## Feature TODO List

 - [ ] Restrict access to admin session only - so till users must be authed admin users
 - [ ] ** Remove hard-coded logo
 - [ ] Main MAP Menu for POS
 - [ ] Customer ID for Walk-in Customer - guest@divinetrash.co.uk
 - [ ] Ensure focus is always on search
 - [ ] Merge / Use search input to add single result searches to cart
 - [x] Always show minicart (not needed anymore)
 - [ ] Add something to the basket when there's no items in there (widget of popular products?)
 - [ ] Create homepage content as part of module's installation?
 - [ ] Create "walk-in" or "guest" customer as part of module's installation. This will allow me to check this on the frontend for customer account changes
 - [ ] Customer account changes - only show recent sales in customer account if customer is "walk-in" or "guest" (as above)
 - [ ] Qty buttons in basket for sausage fingers
 - [ ] Swipe to delete on ios in basket

## Thoughts for future Dev
